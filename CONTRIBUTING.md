### 2. How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Before making any changes, fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. Branch names should follow this convention:
   - For features: `feature/feature-name`
   - For bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-number-description`
   - For documentation: `docs/description`
   
   Example: `feature/add-authentication` or `bugfix/issue-42-login-error`

3. **Make Changes**: 
   - Ensure your changes are well-documented, and the code is clean and readable.
   - Follow the coding style of the project (e.g., indentation, variable naming, etc.).
   - Include comments when necessary to explain complex logic.
   
4. **Test Your Code**: Before submitting a pull request, please test your code to make sure it works as expected and does not break existing functionality.

### 3. Pull Request Guidelines
1. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request.
   - PRs should have a meaningful title and a clear description of the changes you’ve made.
   - Reference any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Closes #42`).
   - If your PR addresses a feature or bug fix, please explain the reasoning behind your solution.
   
2. **Review Process**: 
   - One or more maintainers will review your pull request.
   - If changes are requested, please address them promptly.
   - Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the `main` branch.
   
3. **Avoid Large Pull Requests**: Try to break large changes into smaller, focused pull requests to make them easier to review.

### 4. Issue Reporting
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please follow these guidelines:
1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before opening a new issue, check if there’s already an issue covering your problem.
2. **Open a New Issue**: If no issue exists, create a new one with a descriptive title and detailed information.
   - For bug reports, include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
   - For feature requests, explain the use case and how it will benefit the project.

### 5. Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected. No direct commits are allowed. All changes must be made via pull requests.

### 6. Commit Message Guidelines
Please follow these conventions for writing commit messages:
- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Keep commit messages short and informative.
- Reference the issue number in your commit message if applicable (e.g., `Fix issue #42`).
